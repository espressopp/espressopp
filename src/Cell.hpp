  /** A cell is a structure that manages a list of particles and a
      list of other cells that are active geometric neighbor cells.

      A word about the interacting neighbor cells:
      
      In a 3D lattice each cell has 27 neighbors (including
      itself!). Since we deal with pair forces, it is sufficient to
      calculate only half of the interactions (Newtons law: actio =
      reactio). For each cell 13+1=14 neighbors. This has only to be
      done for the inner cells.
      
      Caution: This implementation needs double sided ghost
      communication! For single sided ghost communication one would
      need some ghost-ghost cell interaction as well, which we do not
      need!
	
      It follows: inner cells: #neighbors = 14
      ghost cells:             #neighbors = 0
