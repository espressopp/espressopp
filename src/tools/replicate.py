  Replicates configuration in each dimension. 
  
  This may be used to increase the size of an equilibrated melt by a factor of 8 or more.

  Presently this routine works only for semiflexible polymers. A general
  class should be written to deal with files containing coordinates
  and topology data.

  xdim = ydim = zdim = 1 returns the original system not replicated.
  xdim = ydim = zdim = 2 returns the original system replicated to 8x.
  xdim = ydim = zdim = 3 returns the original system replicated to 27x.
  xdim = ydim = 1, zdim = 2 returns the original system replicated in the z-direction.
