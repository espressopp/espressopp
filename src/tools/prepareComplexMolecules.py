.. function:: espressopp.tools.findConstrainedBonds(atomPids, bondtypes, bondtypeparams, masses, massCutoff = 1.1)

  Finds all heavyatom-hydrogen bonds in a given list of particle IDs, and outputs a list describing the bonds, in a format suitable for use with the RATTLE algorithm for constrained bonds
  
  :param atomPids: list of pids of atoms between which to search for bonds
  :type atomPids: list of int
  :param bondtypes: dictionary mapping from tuple of pids to bondtypeid, e.g. as returned by tools.convert.gromacs.read()
  :type bondtypes: dict, key: (int,int), value: int
  :param bondtypeparams: dictionary mapping from bondtypeid to class storing parameters of that bond type, e.g. as returned by tools.convert.gromacs.read()
  :type bondtypeparams: dict, key: int, value: espressopp bond type
  :param masses: list of masses, e.g. as returned by tools.convert.gromacs.read()
  :type masses: list of float
  :param massCutoff: for identifying light atoms (hydrogens), default 1.1 mass units, can also be increased e.g. for use with deuterated systems
  :type massCutoff: float
  :returns:
    | hydrogenIDs - list of pids (integer) of light atoms (hydrogens)
    | constrainedBondsDict - dict, keys: pid (integer) of heavy atom, values: list of pids of light atoms that are bonded to it
    | constrainedBondsList - list of lists, one entry for each constrained bond with format: [pid of heavy atom, pid of light atom, bond distance, mass of heavy atom ,mass of light atom]
  
  Can then be used with RATTLE, e.g.
  
  >>> rattle = espresso.integrator.Rattle(system, maxit = 1000, tol = 1e-6, rptol = 1e-6)
  >>> rattle.addConstrainedBonds(constrainedBondsList)
  >>> integrator.addExtension(rattle)


.. function:: espressopp.tools.getInternalNonbondedInteractions(atExclusions,pidlist)

  Gets the non-bonded pairs within a list of particle indices, excluding those which are in a supplied list of exclusions. Useful for example for getting the internal atomistic non-bonded interactions in a coarse-grained particle and adding them as a fixedpairlist
  
  :param atExclusions: list of excluded pairs
  :type atExclusions: list of 2-tuples of int
  :param pidlist: list of pids among which to create pairs
  :type pidlist: list of int
  :return: list of pairs which are not in atExclusions
  :rtype: list of 2-tuples of int
