helper functions for calculating certain types of energy on the python level

.. function:: espressopp.tools.getSelfExclEnergyReactionField(system,exclusions,prefactor,epsilon1,epsilon2,rc,pidlist=[],nParticles=0)

  When calculating the electrostatic energy using the reaction field approach, a correction should also be applied to all excluded atom pairs, including self pairs. This function is for calculating the additional contribution to the electrostatic energy from those 'self' and 'excluded' interactions.

 If a list of pids is supplied, the self and exclusion energy is calculated only for particles in the list. Otherwise, if the variable nParticles is supplied, the calculation is for all particles with pid 1 to nParticles inclusive.

  Note: this is not generalised reaction field (i.e. the generalised reaction field parameter kappa is set to zero).

  :param system: espressopp system
  :type system: System object
  :param exclusions: list of all pairs of particles with non-bonded exclusions in the system
  :type exclusions: list of 2-tuples
  :param prefactor: electrostatic prefactor in the desired units, e.g. 138.935485 kJ mol^-1 e^-2
  :type prefactor: real
  :param epsilon1: epsilon1 of reaction field potential, e.g. 1
  :type epsilon1: real
  :param epsilon2: epsilon2 of reaction field potential, e.g. approximately 80 for water
  :type epsilon2: real
  :param rc: interaction cutoff
  :type rc: real
  :param pidlist: (optional) list of pids for which the self and exclusion energy is calculated
  :type pidlist: list of integers
  :param nParticles: (optional) if pidlist is not supplied, the self and exclusion energy is calculated for all particles with pids from 1 to nParticles inclusive
  :type nParticles: integer
