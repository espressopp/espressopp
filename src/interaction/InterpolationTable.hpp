/** This class defines an interpolation table that can be used for
    tabbed potentials (pair, bond, angle).

    The interpolation tables are created by fitting cubic splines
    to the file values and interpolating energy and force values at
    each of N distances. During a simulation, these tables are used to
    interpolate energy and force values as needed.

    The interpolation is done via a spline style. The cubic spline
    coefficients are computed and stored at each of the N values in
    the table. The distance is used to find the appropriate set of
    coefficients which are used to evaluate a cubic polynomial which
    computes the energy or force.

    An interpolation table can be used to define a mapping from a
    value (e.g. distance r, but also angles) to an energy and a force
    value. The table itself is read from a file and provides energy and
    force values for equidistant values in a given range.
