Abstract output class for LB simulations. The implemented realisations are:

* :class:`espressopp.analysis.LBOutputScreen` to output simulation progress and control flux conservation when using MD to LB coupling.
* :class:`espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzInTime` to output velocity component :math:`v_z` on the lattice site with an index :math:`(0.25*N_i, 0, 0)` in time.
* :class:`espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzOfX` to output local density :math:`\rho` and :math:`v_z` component of the velocity as a function of the coordinate :math:`x`.

.. Note::

    all derived output classes have to be called from class :class:`espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze`
    with specified periodicity of invokation and after this added to the integrator. See examples.
