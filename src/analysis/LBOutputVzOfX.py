Computes and outputs simulation progress (finished step) and controls flux
conservation when using MD to LB coupling.

.. py:class:: espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzOfX(system,lb)

    :param shared_ptr system: system object defined earlier in the python-script
    :param lb_object lb: lattice boltzmann object defined earlier in the python-script

Example:

>>> # initialise output of the Vz as a function of x-coordinate
>>> outputVzOfX = espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzOfX(system,lb)
>>>
>>> # initialise external analysis object with previously created output object
>>> # and periodicity of invocation (steps):
>>> extAnalysis = espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze(outputVzOfX,100)
>>>
>>> # add the external analysis object as an extension to the integrator
>>> integrator.addExtension( extAnalysis )
