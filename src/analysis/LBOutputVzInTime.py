Computes and outputs the velocity component :math:`v_z` in time on the lattice site with 
an index :math:`(0.25*N_i, 0, 0)`.

.. py:class:: espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzInTime(system,lb)

	:param shared_ptr system: system object defined earlier in the python-script
	:param lb_object lb: lattice boltzmann object defined earlier in the python-script

Example:

>>> # initialise output of the Vz as a function of time 
>>> outputVzInTime = espressopp.analysis.LBOutputVzInTime(system,lb)
>>>
>>> # initialise external analysis object with previously created output object
>>> # and periodicity of invocation (steps):
>>> extAnalysis = espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze(outputVzInTime,100)
>>>
>>> # add the external analysis object as an extension to the integrator
>>> integrator.addExtension( extAnalysis )
