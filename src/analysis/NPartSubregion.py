espressopp.analysis.NPartSubregion
********************************

Class to compute the number of (coarse-grained) particles in a subregion of the simulation box.

Examples:

>>> subregionparticles_instance = espressopp.analysis.NPartSubregion(system, parttype=1, span=0.75, geometry=1, center=[Lx/2, Ly/2, Lz/2])
>>> # creates instance of the class for calculating number of particles of type 1 in a subregion centered in the simulation box and bounded within +-0.75 in x-direction from the center

>>> number_of_particles = subregionparticles_instance.compute()
>>> # computes the number of particles in subregion of the simulation box

.. function:: espressopp.analysis.NPartSubregion(system, parttype, span, geometry, center)

                Constructs the NPartSubregion object.

                :param system: system object
                :param parttype: particle type to be considered for particle number calculation
                :param span: radius of the subregion to be considered
                :param geometry: geometry of the subregion. Can only be in ['spherical', 'bounded-x', 'bounded-y', 'bounded-z']
                :param center: center of the subregion
                :type system: shared_ptr<System>
                :type parttype: int
                :type span: real
                :type geometry: str in ['spherical', 'bounded-x', 'bounded-y', 'bounded-z']
                :type center: list of 3 reals (x,y,z coordinates of center)

.. function:: espressopp.analysis.NPartSubregion.compute():

                Calculates the number of particles in defined subregion.
