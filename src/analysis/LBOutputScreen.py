Computes and outputs to the screen the simulation progress (finished step) and
controls mass flux conservation when using MD-to-LB coupling. Ideally, the sum of mass
fluxes should be :math:`0`, i.e. :math:`j_{LB} + j_{MD} = 0`.

.. py:class:: espressopp.analysis.LBOutputScreen(system,lb)

	:param shared_ptr system: system object defined earlier in the python-script
	:param lb_object lb: lattice boltzmann object defined earlier in the python-script

Example:

>>> # initialise output to the screen 
>>> outputScreen = espressopp.analysis.LBOutputScreen(system,lb)
>>>
>>> # initialise external analysis object with previously created output object 
>>> # and periodicity of invocation (steps):
>>> extAnalysis = espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze(outputScreen,100)
>>>
>>> # add the external analysis object as an extension to the integrator
>>> integrator.addExtension( extAnalysis )
