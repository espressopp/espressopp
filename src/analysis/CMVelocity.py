*********************************
espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity
*********************************

Compute and reset (set to zero) the center-of-mass (CM) velocity of the system. 

.. class:: espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity(system)

    :param system: system object
    :type system: espressopp.System
    
    .. note:: 
            
        :class:`CMVelocity <espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity>` can be attached to 
        the *integrator*. In this case the :meth:`reset` method is called, so 
        you will reset the CM-velocity every `n-th` steps.

    **Methods**

    .. function:: espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity.compute()

        Compute the CM-velocity of the system
        
        :rtype: Real3D

    .. function:: espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity.reset()

        Reset (set to zero) the CM-velocity of the system. Done by computing the
        CM-velocity of the system and subtracting it then from every particle.
        
        :rtype: void

    Example of resetting velocity

    >>> total_velocity = espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity(system)
    >>> total_velocity.reset()

    Example of attaching to integrator

    >>> # This extension can be attached to integrator
    >>> # and run `reset()` every `n-th` steps.
    >>> total_velocity = espressopp.analysis.CMVelocity(system)
    >>> ext_remove_com = espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze(total_velocity, 10)
    >>> integrator.addExtension(ext_remove_com)
