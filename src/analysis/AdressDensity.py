espressopp.analysis.AdressDensity
*********************************

Class to compute radial density profiles in adaptive resolution simulations based on distance to closest AdResS center. Works also for multiple overlapping AdResS regions.

Examples:

>>> densityprofile = espressopp.analysis.AdressDensity(system, verletlist)
>>> # creates the class

>>> densityprofile.addExclusions([1,2,3])
>>> # defines particle to be excluded from the calculation based on list of particle ids

>>> densityprofile.compute(100)
>>> # computes the densityprofile using 100 bins

.. function:: espressopp.analysis.AdressDensity(system, verletlist)

        :param system: system object
        :type system: shared_ptr<System>
        :param verletlist: verletlist object
        :type verletlist: shared_ptr<VerletListAdress>

.. function:: espressopp.analysis.AdressDensity.compute(bins)

        :param bins: number of bins
        :type bins: int
        :rtype: list of reals

.. function:: espressopp.analysis.AdressDensity.addExclusions(pidlist)

        :param pidlist: list of ids of particles to be excluded from the calculation
        :type pidlist: list of ints
