This class allows to set or add external periodic forces 
(*lattice units*) to the LB-fluid. At first, one has to create a force object and then 
set or add this force to the system.

.. note::

    Please note, that a periodic (sin-like) force acts in *z*-direction as a function 
    of *x*. The *z*-component of the force provides therefore the amplitude of the
    sin-modulation. The *x*- and *y*-components of the specified force interpreted as
    body forces in corresponding directions.
    
Example to set external sin-like force.

>>> ampFz = 0.0001
>>> Fx = Fy = 0.
>>> extForceToSet = Real3D( Fx, Fy, ampFz )
>>> lbforceSin = espressopp.integrator.LBInitConstForce(system,lb)
>>> lbforceSin.setForce( extForceToSet )

Example to add external sin-like force. 

>>> ampFz = 0.0005
>>> Fx = Fy = 0.
>>> extForceToAdd = Real3D( Fx, Fy, ampFz )
>>> lbforceSin = espressopp.integrator.LBInitConstForce(system,lb)
>>> lbforceSin.addForce( extForceToAdd )
