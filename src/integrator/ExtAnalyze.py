espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze
********************************

This class can be used to execute nearly all analysis objects
within the main integration loop which allows to automatically
accumulate time averages (with standard deviation error bars). 
  
Example Usage:

>>> pt           = espressopp.analysis.PressureTensor(system)
>>> extension_pt = espressopp.integrator.ExtAnalyze(pt , interval=100)
>>> integrator.addExtension(extension_pt)
>>> integrator.run(10000)
>>>
>>> pt_ave = pt.getAverageValue()
>>> print "average Pressure Tensor = ", pt_ave[:6]
>>> print "          std deviation = ", pt_ave[6:]
>>> print "number of measurements  = ", pt.getNumberOfMeasurements()
