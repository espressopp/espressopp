R"""
This abstract class provides the interface to (re-)initialize populations and handle external forces.

.. py:class:: espressopp.integrator.LBInit

    .. py:method:: createDenVel(rho0,u0)
  
        to set initial density and velocity of the LB-fluid.
  
        :param real rho0: density
        :param Real3D u0: velocity
  
    The following options for LB-fluid initialization are supported:
  
    * :class:`espressopp.integrator.LBInitPopUniform` A typical choice. It initializes uniformly distributed density and velocity: On every lattice site the density is ``rho0`` and velocity is ``u0``
    
    * :class:`espressopp.integrator.LBInitPopWave` for uniform density at every lattice site, but harmonic velocity :math:`v_z (x)` with the period of lattice sites in *x*-direction
    
    .. py:method:: setForce(value)

        to set an external force onto LB-fluid.

        :param Real3D value: value of the force

    .. py:method:: addForce(force)

        to add a new external force to the existing one.

        :param Real3D force: value of the force

    Two main external force types are implemented:

    * :class:`espressopp.integrator.LBInitConstForce` to manage constant (gravity-like) forces acting on every lattice site and
    
    * :class:`espressopp.integrator.LBInitPeriodicForce` to manage periodic (sin-like) forces
