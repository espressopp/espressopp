**********************************************
espressopp.integrator.LangevinThermostatHybrid
**********************************************

As LangevinThermostat, but for use in AdResS systems, to allow the application of different thermostat friction constants (:math:`\gamma`) to different AdResS regions. Uses three values of :math:`\gamma`, one for the atomistic region, one for the hybrid region, and one for the coarse-grained region.

  >>> # create FixedTupleList object
  >>> ftpl = espressopp.FixedTupleListAdress(system.storage)
  >>> ftpl.addTuples(tuples)
  >>> system.storage.setFixedTuplesAdress(ftpl)
  >>>
  >>> system.storage.decompose()
  >>>
  >>> # create Langevin thermostat
  >>> thermostat             = espressopp.integrator.LangevinThermostatHybrid(system,ftpl)
  >>>
  >>> # set Langevin friction constants
  >>> thermostat.gamma       = 0.0 # units = 1/timeunit
  >>> print "# gamma for atomistic region for langevin thermostat = ",thermostat.gamma
  >>> thermostat.gammahy     = 10.0 # units = 1/timeunit
  >>> print "# gamma for hybrid region for langevin thermostat = ",thermostat.gammahy
  >>> thermostat.gammacg     = 10.0 # units = 1/timeunit
  >>> print "# gamma for coarse-grained region for langevin thermostat = ",thermostat.gammacg
  >>>
  >>> # set temperature of thermostat
  >>> thermostat.temperature = kBT
  >>> # kBT is a float with the value of temperature in reduced units, i.e. temperature * Boltzmann's constant in appropriate units

No need to include the line

  >>> thermostat.adress = True

as is necessary in the case of the basic LangevinThermostat, because LangevinThermostatHybrid is always only used in AdResS systems
