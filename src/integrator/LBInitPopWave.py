R"""

This class creates LB-fluid with uniform density and harmonic velocity (*lattice units*):

:math:`v_x = 0`,
:math:`v_y = 0`,
:math:`v_z(i) = A \cdot sin (2 \pi \cdot i \,/ N_x)`,
where :math:`A` is the amplitude of the velocity wave, 
:math:`N_x` is the number of lattice nodes in :math:`x`-direction and 
:math:`i` is the index of the node the velocity is calculated for.

This may be used to test the system: total moment is zero and the liquid tends to 
equilibrium, i.e. relaxes to a uniform zero velocity.
    
Example:

>>> # set initial density
>>> initDen = 1.
>>>
>>> # set initial velocity
>>> Vx = Vy = 0.
>>> ampVz = 0.0005
>>> initVel = Real3D( Vx, Vy, ampVz )
>>>
>>> # create initPop object and initialize populations
>>> initPop = espressopp.integrator.LBInitPopWave(system,lb)
>>> initPop.createDenVel( initDen, initVel )
