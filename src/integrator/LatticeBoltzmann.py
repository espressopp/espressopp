.. |espp| replace:: ESPResSo++

The LatticeBoltzmann (LB) class controls fluid hydrodynamics and allows for hybrid
LB/MD simulations. It is implemented as :py:class:`espressopp.integrator.Extension` in |espp|.

.. py:class:: espressopp.integrator.LatticeBoltzmann(system, nodeGrid, \
                                                    a = 1., tau = 1., \
                                                    numDims = 3, numVels = 19)

    :param shared_ptr system: system object
    :param Int3D nodeGrid: arrangement of CPUs in space
    :param real a: lattice spacing (in lattice units).
    :param real tau: time discretization (in lattice units)
    :param int numDims: dimensionality of the LB model
    :param int numVels: number of velocity vectors in the LB model
    :returns: lb object

    The LB-fluid in |espp| is aiming at simulations of complex soft matter systems. 
    They consist of MD particles (colloids, composite nanoparticles or polymer chains) 
    that are solved in the LB-fluid preserving hydrodynamic interactions.
    
    The default lattice model is D3Q19 (``numDims = 3``, ``numVels = 19``) and both lattice
    spacing ``a`` and timestep ``tau`` are set to 1. If some other lattice model is needed
    feel free to modify the code: adding 3D ones is straightforward, 
    for 2D cases one has to make more thouroughs changes.
    
    The parameters of the LB-fluid are expected in Lennard-Jones (LJ) units. This 
    strategy helps users with MD-background think of LB-fluid in term of LJ liquid. One
    only has to specify its properties such as liquid density,
    :math:`\\rho`, temperature, :math:`T`, and viscosity, :math:`\\eta`. 
    
    .. note::

        Standard LJ fluid can be characterized by
        :math:`\\rho \\sim 1 [\\sigma^{-3}]`,
        :math:`T \\sim 1 [\\epsilon]`, and 
        :math:`\\eta \\sim 5 [\\epsilon \\tau / \\sigma^3]`


    Example

    >>> L = 20
    >>>
    >>> # create cubic box
    >>> box = (L, L, L)
    >>> # The rc+skin= lattice_size
    >>> rc = 0.9
    >>>	skin= 0.1 
    >>>
    >>> # initialize empty default system with the created cubic box.
    >>> system, integrator = espressopp.standard_system.Default(box)
    >>>
    >>> # nodeGrid is determined based on the number of CPUs used for simulation among others
    >>> nodeGrid=espressopp.tools.decomp.nodeGrid(espressopp.MPI.COMM_WORLD.size,box,rc,skin)
    >>>
    >>> # initialize lb object. The dimensions of the lattice are obtained from the
    >>> # system's box dimensions employing lattice spacing 1.
    >>> lb = espressopp.integrator.LatticeBoltzmann(system, nodeGrid)

    **Methods**

    .. py:method:: getLBMom(node, moment)
    
        Get hydrodynamic moment from a specific node
        
        :param Int3D node: node index
        :param int moment: hydrodynamic moment to get
        
        Use 0 to get density :math:`\\rho` and 1-3 for \
        mass flux components :math:`j_x`, :math:`j_y` and :math:`j_z`, correspondingly.
    
    .. py:method:: setLBMom(node, moment, value)
    
        Set hydrodynamic moment for a specific node
        
        :param Int3D node: node index
        :param int moment: hydrodynamic moment to set
        :param real value: value to set
    
    .. py:method:: saveLBConf()
    
        Dumps LB configuration with separate files for coupling forces, \
        LB-fluid moments and populations (the last one is a bit overkill). \
        The dump files are written for every CPU separately and \
        are put in the *dump* folder

    .. py:method:: keepLBDump()
    
        Sets a flag to keep previously dumped LB configuration. \
        Normally the previous dump is deleted after a new one is made.
        
        Example
        
        >>> # set bulk viscosity
        >>> for k in range (10):
        >>>     integrator.run(50000)
        >>>
        >>>     # output LB configuration
        >>>     lb.keepLBDump()         # flag to keep previously saved LB state
        >>>     lb.saveLBConf()         # saves current state of the LB fluid
