ESPResSo++ is an extensible, flexible, fast and parallel simulation software for
soft matter research. It is a highly versatile software package for the
scientific simulation and analysis of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring
models as they are used in soft matter research. ESPResSo and ESPResSo++ have
common roots and share parts of the developer/user community. However their
development is independent and they are different software packages. ESPResSo++
is free, open-source software published under the GNU General Public License
(GPL).

# Quick start:

To get a copy of the developer version (most recent version) of ESPResSo++, you can use git or docker. Using docker will give you a binary release (nothing to compile, but performance may not be optimal). If you use git clone or download a tarball, you will have to compile ESPResSo+ yourself, which might lead to better performance.

Using [docker](https://www.docker.com):
```sh
$ docker pull espressopp/espressopp
$ docker run -it espressopp/espressopp /bin/bash
```

Using git:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/espressopp/espressopp.git
```

Alternatively, you can download a tarball or zip file of [previous release versions](https://github.com/espressopp/espressopp/releases) of ESPResSo++.

# Dependencies
## C++ Dependencies
 - Boost ( >= 1.69.0)
 - MPI
 - FFTW3
 - GROMACS (required when `WITH_XTC` flag is enabled)
 - HDF5

## Python Dependencies
ESPResSo++ requires Python 3.7 or newer. All required Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them via: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

# Quick install:

```sh
$ cd espressopp
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/where/to/install/espressopp .
$ make -j2
$ make install
$ export PYTHONPATH=/where/to/install/espressopp/lib/python3*/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}
```

After building go to the `examples` directory and have a look at the Python scripts.

You can also use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), simply after compilation call in the root directory
```sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```

then you can go to `examples` and have a look at the Python scripts.

## CMake options

You can customize the build process by applying following CMake flags

 - `WITH_XTC` - build E++ with support of dumping trajectory to GROMACS xtc files (default: OFF).
 - `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` - where the E++ should be installed.
 - `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` - put specific compilation flags.

Then, the flags can be used in `cmake`

```sh
$ cmake . -DWITH_XTC=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-O3
$ make
```

You can include ScaFaCoS Library (pre-installation required, see in http://www.scafacos.de/) into E++ compilation

```sh
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=[installation directory]
$ cmake --build .
```

You can also include Random123 Library (ONLY used for DPD thermostat, pre-download required)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DEShawResearch/random123.git
$ cmake . -DRANDOM123_ROOT_DIR=[download directory]
$ cmake --build .
```
