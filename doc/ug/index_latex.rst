ESPResSo++
========================

.. |espp| replace:: ESPResSo++

**Welcome to the homepage of the ESPResSo++ project**

|espp| is an extensible, flexible, fast and parallel simulation software for soft matter research.
It is a highly versatile software package for the scientific simulation and analysis
of coarse-grained atomistic or bead-spring models as they are used in soft matter research.

`ESPResSo <http://espressomd.org>`_ and |espp| have common roots and share parts of
the developer/user community. However their development is independent and they 
are different software packages. 

|espp| is free, open-source software published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
