Overview
========

.. |espp| replace:: ESPResSo++

- highly modularized object oriented and efficient C++ code
- parallelized with MPI
- python user interface
- classical MD simulations with short and long ranged pair, angular or dihedral interactions
- efficient Adaptive Resolution Scheme (AdResS) implementation
- multisystem integrator (e.g. for parallel tempering)
- reads input files of GROMACS, LAMMPS, and ESPResSo
