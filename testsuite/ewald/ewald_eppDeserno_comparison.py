#  the system: the box size, particle id, position and charge.
#
#  File 'deserno_ewald.dat' contains results which were obtained by Markus Deserno for exactly
#  the same system. Ewald parameter (alpha = 1.112583061), Cutoff in R space (rspacecutoff = 4.9)
#  cutoff in K space (kspacecutoff = 30). It compares the results of Markus Deserno with Espresso++
#  implementation. The forces which affect the particles, total energy and the differences between
#  Deserno's results and Espresso++ implementation are printed at the end of the script.
