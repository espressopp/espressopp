.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes the *MPI for Python* package.  *MPI for
   Python* provides bindings of the *Message Passing Interface* (MPI)
   standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python
   program to exploit multiple processors.

   This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/2/3 specifications
   and provides an object oriented interface which resembles the
   MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives)
   and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of
   any *picklable* Python object, as well as optimized communications
   of Python object exposing the single-segment buffer interface
   (NumPy arrays, builtin bytes/string/array objects)
